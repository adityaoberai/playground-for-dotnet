# playground-for-dotnet
Simple examples that help you get started with Appwrite + .NET (=❤️)

## Get Started

This playground doesn't include any C# best practices but rather intended to show some of the most simple examples and use cases of using the Appwrite API in your .NET application.

### System Requirements
* A system with [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) installed.
* You have a running instance of Appwrite (localhost in most cases).
* Create a project in Appwrite.
* Generate an API Key in Appwrite.

### Installation
Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/appwrite/playground-for-dotnet.git
```
Restore all project dependencies:
```sh
dotnet restore
```
Replace `[ENDPOINT]`, `[PROJECT_ID]` and `[API_KEY]` with your credentials, `[FUNCTION_ID]` with the id of any Appwrite function you would like to test and `[DIRECTORY_PATH]` with the path of your project directory in *Program.cs*.

To run your Playground, run following command:

```sh
dotnet run
```
